>*A novel approach towards personalized playlist generation based on a user's preferences and listening history.*

# Intro
I first started using [Last.fm](https://last.fm) over nine years ago, as I was interested in keeping track of my music listening history. While I now faintly recall the red “a” appearing in the menu bar, I remember using it to journal my iTunes plays in a process called “scrobbling.”  Fast forward nine years, to right after hitting the 100,000 scrobble mark, and I realized I had a large set of personalized listening data that I was interested in analyzing and exploring. Analyzing to get some general statistics as to my most listened to artists ([Flying Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK-VuOn1rgs)), and tracks ([DDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2O-Ggo7yoo) by Machinedrum), amongst other musical superlatives. And exploring to see what patterns emerged, and if said patterns could help me learn about myself in new ways.
